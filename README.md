# Homework-2-Nav-Mesh
2nd Homework Assignment- Nav Mesh

This assignment we used 3d models and plane primitives to generate a nav mesh. I had some problems with the models I wanted to use, eventually settling on a tree after issues with car models had risen. I remembered that scaling the model was very important, as the first models imported were not visible at native scale.
